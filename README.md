# cs-studies
A repository that consists of my cs study files

# Why?
I'm studying civil engineering at METU, but I'm trying to switch careers to
computer science. Thus this repo.

# Contents
There is a file called [curriculum.md](curriculum.md) that contains the
curriculum I've prepared for myself. It contains the topics I want to study,
the resources I want to use, and the order I want to study them in.

There are also directories for each phase and topics in the curriculum.
In each directory, there are files that contain the notes I've taken while
studying the topics, exercises I've solved, and other resources I've used.
